Heimdall Client and API is a github project created for Heimdall Inc. I went a step further and created an integrated frontend Homepage that performs input validation using the API, favoring vanilla js/html/css to punctuate my prowess.
Other API calls were to be integrated but the idea was scratched for the sake of brevity. Please use at your own pace.
